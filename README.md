- 👋 Hi, I’m @CarlosLiberJesus! In my little internet conner, I mingle open-source, political activism and individual freedom. I'm a freelancer, entrepreneur, mind-set kinda guy! Still believe any human can write a piece of code that changes someone's life, and we all have to dutty to build better *software*, even if is just another service. Also come with a some bagadge, over the time spent on corporations and state dependency... As the world envolves, I dare too, even though I can't keep it's speed, I keep building! It's an artist calling..
 
- 👀 I’m interested in developing, creating products and services, something I can express myself. As a software engeneer, full-stack is not enought.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI Agents! The world is changing, better tools and automations can be built.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything open-source, pro-bono, community driven.

- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'll joke when job is done, I'm already late in deadlines :)
