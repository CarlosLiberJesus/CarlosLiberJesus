- 👋 Hi, I’m @CarlosLiberJesus! In my little internet conner, I mingle open-source, political activism and individual freedom. I'm more a freelancer, entrepreneur, with a some bagadge... As the world envolves, I dare too, even though I can't keep it's speed!
 
- 👀 I’m interested in developing, creating products and services, something I can express myself. As a software engeneer, full-stack is not enought.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI Agents! The world is changing, better tools and automations can be built.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything open-source, pro-bono, community driven.

- 📫 How to reach me: bewhy.org@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'll joke when job is done, I'm already late in deadlines :)
